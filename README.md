# Predicting Blood Donation

This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict whether individuals will donate blood in March 2007 based on various features. The model is implemented using Python and leverages the scikit-learn library for training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the prediction model, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/S-Hari-Prasad-Reddy/Predicting-Blood-Donation
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook:** Navigate to the cloned directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file (`predicting_blood_donation.ipynb`) using Google Colab. You can do this by clicking on the following link: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/S-Hari-Prasad-Reddy/Predicting-Blood-Donation/blob/main/Predicting%20Blood%20Donation%20.ipynb).

3. **Run the Notebook:** Once the notebook is opened in Google Colab, you can run each cell to explore the data, preprocess it, build the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## Contents

- **`data/`**: This directory contains the dataset (`transfusion.csv`) used for training and testing the model.
- **`predicting_blood_donation.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: This readme file providing an overview of the repository.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn (for visualization)
- Google Colab (for interactive notebook execution)

You can easily install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy seaborn
```
